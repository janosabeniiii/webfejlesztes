            <h2>What is F1?</h2>
            <p>Formula 1 (F1) is the highest level of single-seater, open-wheel auto racing in the world. It represents the pinnacle of motorsport, combining speed, engineering, technology, and driver skill in a highly competitive and prestigious series. Formula 1 is governed by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), which sets strict rules for the cars, the races, and the championship.</p>
            <div id="pontok"></div>
            <h2>The Races</h2>
            <p>At the core of F1 is a series of races known as Grands Prix, which take place on purpose-built circuits and sometimes on city streets, known as street circuits. The season typically runs from March to December, with races held across different continents in Europe, Asia, the Americas, and the Middle East, among others. Each Grand Prix is contested over a set number of laps or hours, depending on the race, with points awarded based on finishing position.</p>
            <div id="pontok"></div>
            <h2>The Cars</h2>
            <p>The cars used in F1 are cutting-edge, purpose-built machines designed for speed, precision, and safety. They are powered by hybrid engines that combine an internal combustion engine with an energy recovery system, making them both powerful and energy-efficient. F1 cars can reach speeds of over 200 mph and are capable of accelerating from 0 to 60 mph in under 2 seconds. The cars’ aerodynamic design is a critical element, ensuring they can maintain grip on the track while minimizing drag.</p>
            <div id="pontok"></div>
            <h2>The Teams</h2>
            <p>F1 teams are composed of some of the best engineers, strategists, and mechanics in the world. The cars are not only fast but also incredibly complex, with thousands of components working together to deliver performance and reliability. Teams like Ferrari, Mercedes, Red Bull Racing, and McLaren have long histories in the sport and are known for their fierce rivalries on and off the track.</p>
            <div id="pontok"></div>
            <h2>The Drivers</h2>
            <p>The drivers themselves are some of the most skilled and fearless athletes in the world. To compete in Formula 1, a driver must have exceptional reflexes, focus, and stamina, as well as the ability to make split-second decisions. Drivers like Michael Schumacher, Ayrton Senna, Lewis Hamilton, and Sebastian Vettel have achieved legendary status in the sport. The title of World Champion is awarded to the driver who accumulates the most points throughout the season, a feat that demands consistency, resilience, and brilliance.</p>
            <div id="pontok"></div>
            <h2>Behind The Scenes</h2>
            <p>Formula 1 is not just about the drivers and the cars; it’s also about the strategy. Teams make crucial decisions during the race regarding pit stops, tire choices, and race tactics, all of which can impact the final outcome. The sport is a dynamic mix of speed, precision, and tactical genius, with teams constantly pushing the boundaries of what is possible.</p>
            <div id="pontok"></div>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
